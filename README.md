Introduction
-
Built a neural network to carry out a prediction problem on a real bike sharing dataset. Follow instructions below to attempt to build the neural network yourself, or download/clone this repo to view my implementation.

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

Instructions
-

1. Download the project materials from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning). You can either download the repository with `git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git`, or download it as an archive file from [this link](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/archive/master.zip).
2. cd into the first-neural-network directory.
3. Download anaconda or miniconda.
4. Create a new conda environment:

`conda create --name dlnd python=3`

5. Enter your new environment:

    1.  Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd
    2. `Windows: >> activate dlnd`

6. Ensure you have `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `jupyter notebook` installed by doing the following:

`conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook`

7. Download or clone this repo:

`git clone git@github.com:amtruenorth/bike-sharing-neural-network.git`

Usage:
-
8. Run the following:

`jupyter notebook`

8. To attempt your own neural network, in your browser window that opens, open `first-neural-network.ipynb`

9. To view my implimentation, in your browser, open `bike-sharing-neural-network.html`.

10. To edit my implimentation's notebook, in your browswer, open `bike-sharing-neural-network.ipynb`.

If you need help running the notebook file, check out the [Jupyter notebook lesson](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd101/parts/2a9dba0b-28eb-4b0e-acfa-bdcf35680d90/modules/aba54606-cf35-4a77-b643-efec6a90bfa1/lessons/13f4b7d6-92a9-468d-9008-084fc8b53a23/concepts/75e1eee0-5f81-4d5b-a1ca-eaebe3c91759).
